#### JavaScript 3D library ####

The aim of the project is to create an easy to use, lightweight, cross-browser, general purpose 3D library.

### Usage ###

This code creates a scene, a camera, and a geometric cube, and it adds the cube to the scene. It then creates a `2D` renderer for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the `document.body` element. Finally, it animates the cube within the scene for the camera.
